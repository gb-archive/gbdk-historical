The Gameboy Development Kit was written by Pascal Felber to allow
people to write their own Gameboy games, in C and Z80. It is supplied
with examples and libraries dealing with text and sprite handling, and
the games produced can be played on any platform with a Gameboy
emulator (ie most). My port of it is available, with sources, at:
http://www.plasma.demon.co.uk/gameboy/

Recently added is the maketiles utility, which converts RISC OS
sprites into Gameboy tile data. If you've already downloaded the GBDK,
you ought to get yourself a copy, or creating tiles will be a long and
boring process :)
